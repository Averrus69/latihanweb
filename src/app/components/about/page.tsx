        Hello! My name is Arry Averrus, and I'm an aspiring full-stack
        developer. Currently, I am diving into the world of coding at Purwadhika
        Digital School, where I'm building a strong foundation in both front-end
        and back-end development. As a newbie in the tech world, I'm passionate
        about learning how things work behind the scenes of websites and
        applications. I'm focused on mastering languages like HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, and frameworks like React.js for front-end development. On
        the back-end, I'm learning Node.js, Express, and working with databases
        like MongoDB. My goal is to become a versatile developer, capable of
        working on both the client-side and server-side, and to build functional
        and engaging applications. I'm excited to continue this learning
        journey, solve problems, and create projects that can make a difference.
        Thanks for taking the time to get to know me a little better!
