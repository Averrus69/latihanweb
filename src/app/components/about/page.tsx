        Hello! My name is Arry Averrus, and I am an aspiring full-stack
        developer. Currently, I am diving into the world of coding at Purwadhika
        Digital School, where I am building a strong foundation in both
        front-end and back-end development. As a newbie in the tech world, I am
        passionate about learning how things work behind the scenes of websites
        and applications. I am focused on mastering languages like HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, and frameworks like React.js for front-end development. On
        the back-end, I am learning Node.js, Express, and working with databases
        like MongoDB. My goal is to become a versatile developer, capable of
        working on both the client-side and server-side, and to build functional
        and engaging applications. I am excited to continue this learning
        journey, solve problems, and create projects that can make a difference.
        Thanks for taking the time to get to know me a little better!
